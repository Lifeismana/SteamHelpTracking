[h1]Installing a game from a disc[/h1]

I try to install my retail game from the included disc(s), but the game begins downloading through Steam instead.  What can be done?

If you are using a Mac, you will not be able to install from the disc. Ensure the game is [url=https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=5414-tfbn-1352]activated to your Steam account[/url] so you can download and install it through your Library.

[h1]Using Steam launch options to install retail games from disc[/h1]

[olist]

[*]Log in to Steam and click on [b]Library[/b]

[*]Right-click on the game, select [b]Manage[/b] and then [b]Uninstall[/b]

[*]Insert the first disc into your computer

[*]Close Steam (Steam > Exit)

[*]Press Windows Key + R to open Run

[*]In the Run window type the below line, but you will need to replace E: with the CD/DVD drive you are installing from.  Additionally, you will need to update the C:\Program Files (x86)\ if Steam is installed in a different location on your computer.
[code]"C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steam.exe" -install E:[/code]
[*]Press [b]OK[/b].  Steam will launch and ask you to sign in if you do not have your password saved.  Your installation should continue from the disc.

This process is only intended for retail store bought copies of Steam games (ie. Left 4 Dead, Modern Warfare 2). [b]It will not work for backup discs of any Steam games[/b]
