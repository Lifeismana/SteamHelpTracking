Users with Prime Status are matchmade with and against only other Prime Status users in all game modes.

Prime users also earn XP, Competitive Skill Groups and Counter-Strike Rating, and are eligible for weekly care packages. These benefits apply exclusively to Prime users.

[h2]Can Prime and non-Prime users matchmake together?[/h2]
Yes, but only if these users matchmake from a pre-made lobby. When a Prime and non-Prime user matchmake together the lobby is considered non-Prime and the resulting match would be with and against non-Prime users.

It is not possible for a non-Prime user to play in a Prime-only match.
