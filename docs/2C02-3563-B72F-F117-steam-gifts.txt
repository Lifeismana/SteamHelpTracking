[h2]What is a Steam gift?[/h2]

When you add a game to your cart, you will see the option to "gift" the game to anyone on your[url=https://help.steampowered.com/faqs/view/1902-2D54-E445-59DD] Steam Friends List[/url]. The gift recipient will receive an e-mail with a personal message from you and instructions to redeem the game on their account.

A Steam gift purchase is a one-time transfer—after the recipient has redeemed the gift, it is now a part of his or her Steam games collection. Also note that you may only gift new purchases—you may not transfer games you already own.

[section style=note]If you don't have a Steam account you can purchase a Steam Gift Card and checkout as a guest. Visit [url=https://store.steampowered.com/digitalgiftcards/selectgiftcard]Steam Gift Cards[/url] to get started. Once you've completed the gift purchase, the recipient will receive an email with a link to redeem the gift on their Steam account.

A refund may be issued for any gift that was purchased within fourteen days and has been played less than two hours by the gift recipient. If the refund request is approved, your purchase will be refunded to the original payment method. If your payment method does not support this, your Steam Wallet will be credited the full amount.

[b]Gift Redeemed [/b]
If the gift has already been redeemed, the recipient needs to approve the refund first. If you submit a refund request before the recipient has approved the gift refund, your request will be declined. You'll see the following message when you try to refund a redeemed gift: [i]This product was gifted to user (Account name). They’ll need to use the Help site to agree to a refund before you can request it for this product.[/i]

[h1]Other Common Questions[/h1]
[url id=gifts-error][/url]

[h2]I can’t send a gift to my friend. What do I do?[/h2]

If you’re unable to select a recipient on your Friends List, check the following:

[list]

[*][b]Friend Owns Item[/b]. If anyone on your Friends List owns the game, their names will be grayed out and cannot be selected. Check your friend's Steam Community profile and click the link [i]View all games[/i] to view their list of owned games.

[*][b]Region Restrictions[/b]. Due to regional price differences, some gifts cannot be sent to recipients located in other purchase regions. Territory restrictions are noted on the Steam Store page. Steam Support cannot make changes to territory or language restrictions.

[*][b]Gifting DLC[/b].  Check your friend's Steam Community profile and click the link to "View all games" to view their list of owned games. You won’t be able to purchase DLC (downloadable content) unless they already own the base game.

[*][b]Gifting Bundles[/b]. Some bundles are customized for your account and cannot be gifted. To identify these bundles, look for [i]Complete Your Collection[/i] on the product’s store page.

[*][b]Gifting Multipacks[/b]. All multipacks (2-, 3-, and 4-packs) include multiple copies of the same game. Multipacks cannot be gifted but you can purchase them for your own account; the extra copies can be gifted to your friends and family. For more information, visit [url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/7FA6-7318-AC7F-AF99]Extra Copies[/url].  Note: You can’t purchase a multipack if you already own the game on Steam.  [/*]
[*][b]Game Cannot Be Gifted[/b]. Select titles may not be gifted and the option to send as a gift will not be available during checkout.

To purchase a digital Steam Gift Card for a friend or family member’s account, visit [url=https://store.steampowered.com/digitalgiftcards/selectgiftcard]Steam Gift Cards[/url].

[url id=expire][/url]

[h2]Do gifts expire?[/h2]

After a gift has been delivered to the recipient, they have 30 days to accept the gift. Once the gift has been accepted, the game is permanently added to the Steam account that it was redeemed on. If the recipient doesn't take any action after 30 days, Steam will automatically cancel the gift purchase and issue you a refund to the original payment method.

[url id=gift-revoked][/url]

[h2]Why was my gift revoked?[/h2]

When a gift is refunded due to fraud or a payment dispute, the gift is removed from your Steam library. You will also receive notification that the game is no longer available to play.

If you would like to play the game again in the future, you will need to purchase it from the Steam Store or redeem another gift copy of the title.  Visit [url=https://help.steampowered.com/faqs/view/558E-7FF0-1C5C-D1EE]Revoked Gifts [/url] for additional information.
