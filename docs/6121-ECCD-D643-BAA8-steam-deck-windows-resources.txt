[h4]Dual-Boot with SteamOS not yet available[/h4]

[list]

[*]Installing Windows requires you to wipe your Steam Deck, and dual-boot with SteamOS is not currently available.

[*]While Steam Deck is fully capable of dual-boot, the SteamOS installer that provides a dual-boot wizard isn't ready yet. This will ship alongside SteamOS 3 once it's complete.

[h4]Notes for installing Windows[/h4]

[list]

[*]To get to the boot menu, power down. Then, while holding Volume Down, press the power button.

[*]Installation will be in portrait orientation (sideways) on the Steam Deck screen. You can switch this to landscape once Windows is installed.

[*]To enter your product key during installation, you'll need internet. Because there are no Wi-Fi drivers at this point, you'll need a USB-C hub with an Ethernet port for internet.

[*]For Windows 11, make sure you have the latest OS update (in order to get the latest BIOS with fTPM support) before installing.
