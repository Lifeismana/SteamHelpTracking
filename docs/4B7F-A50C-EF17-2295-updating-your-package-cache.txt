[h1]Updating Your Package Cache[/h1]

How do I update my package cache using Ubuntu 12.04?

Ubuntu maintains a cache of packages that are used when installing a new product. If a recommended package is not in this list, you will be unable to install it. In this case, you will need to refresh the cache before installing the recommended package:

[olist]

[*]Open [b]Update Manager[/b] by clicking the Unity symbol on the taskbar and typing "update manager'".  [/*]
[*]Click the [b]Check [/b]button. This will update your package cache and display any existing updates.
[/olist]

If you have the RTM version of Ubuntu 12.04 and have never installed any of the Ubuntu updates, Steam will fail to install. Applying these updates will fix this.

[h3]NOTE:[/h3]
It is important that your package cache is up to date when you launch Steam because Steam compares your current video driver against the current contents of your package cache.
