[h3]Why did I not earn Armory Credit progress from my last match?[/h3]
There are three reasons Armory Credit progress is not issued:

[list]

[*]The match was non-Prime.

[*]You left the match early (before XP was issued for completing the match).

[*]You or a member of your party caused the match to be canceled for irregular gameplay.
