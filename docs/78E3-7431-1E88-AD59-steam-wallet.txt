[h4]How do I add Wallet Codes to my Steam account? [/h4]
To redeem a Steam Wallet Code on your account, please login to your account and visit [url=https://store.steampowered.com/account/redeemwalletcode]Redeem a Steam Gift Card or Wallet Code[/url] page. Enter your unique wallet code into the “Steam Wallet Code” field and click “Continue” to add the value to your account’s Steam Wallet balance.

If you have never had a Steam Wallet balance on your Steam account, you may be prompted to enter your current address to determine the correct currency for your Steam Wallet. If you have an existing Steam Wallet (regardless of the current balance), the funds will be added in your Steam Wallet’s current currency.

Once a Steam Wallet Code has been redeemed on an account, the wallet funds are then tied to that account; they cannot be moved or withdrawn to a bank account.

Once the purchase has been completed, the gift recipient will receive both an email and a gift notification on their Steam account.

[url id=restrictions][/url]

[h4]Are there country restrictions on Steam Wallet Codes?[/h4]
Yes. We have made some changes to how Steam Wallet Codes are redeemed on Steam, as part of our ongoing effort to reduce scams like the ones explained [url=https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/paying-scammers-gift-cards]here[/url]. These changes should not impact regular customers who enjoy using Steam wallet codes they purchase at retail in their local currency.

Each Steam User Account is associated with a specific currency, which you can see in the top right corner of your Steam Client.  Going forward, you may encounter an error if you try to activate a Steam Wallet Code issued in a different currency than the one of your Steam User Account.

If you have questions about your ability to redeem Steam Wallet Codes, please contact [url=https://help.steampowered.com]Steam Support[/url].  If you are concerned about the legitimacy of a Steam code you have purchased, you should ask your retailer.
