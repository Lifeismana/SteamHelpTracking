[h1]How to Report a Scammer, Hijacker or Phisher[/h1]

Reporting a scammer, hijacker or phisher through their Steam Profile will always be better than submitting a Steam Support ticket containing your report. A community report includes the best information about the interaction between your accounts, and is quicker to review and act on.

Reporting a friend's hijacked account can also be useful for Steam's moderators to lock that account until its owner can recover it.

To avoid scams in the future, ensure that you know the methods that a malicious user may use to attempt to scam. You can find detailed information in the [url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/3195-9FFB-BA06-F25B]Scam FAQ[/url].

[section style=warning][b]Steam moderators do not take action or issue restrictions unless the reported infraction can be verified against the reported account's actual use.[/b]

Some scammers may attempt to threaten your account with mass or automated reporting. Steam disregards all automated or malicious reports and will lock any accounts involved. You can be sure your account is safe from any attempt to weaponize reports unless you're using your account in a way that violates [url=https://store.steampowered.com/subscriber_agreement/]Steam's rules[/url].

Some scammers may claim they've mistakenly or falsely reported you and you need to take action to save your account. This is a scam and can be ignored:
