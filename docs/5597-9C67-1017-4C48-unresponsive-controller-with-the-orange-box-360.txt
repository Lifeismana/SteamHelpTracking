[h1]Unresponsive Controller with The Orange Box (360)[/h1]

Upon launching The Orange Box on Xbox 360, my controller will not respond in the menus or games. How can I fix this?

This error is most likely caused by a wired controller such as a Guitar controller currently plugged into your Xbox 360 console.  Please do the following:

[list]

[*]Shutdown your Xbox 360. [/*]
[*]Remove all controllers and peripherals. [/*]
[*]Restart your console using the Xbox button found on your 360 controller to ensure the controller is recognized in the first port. [/*]
