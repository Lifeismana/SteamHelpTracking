[h1]Screen goes black in the Direct Intervention chapter of Half-Life 2: Episode One[/h1]

The screen goes black in the Direct Intervention chapter of Half-Life 2: Episode One - what can I do to resolve this issue?

This issue is caused by color correction settings obscuring the colors in the map - even if you try to light up the area with the flashlight or gravity gun, all that will be visible on the screen will be the crosshairs.

Please follow the instructions below to correct this issue:
