HARDWARE LIMITED WARRANTY & AGREEMENT[/h1]

[h3]LOCAL APPLICABILITY[/h3]
IF YOU ARE A CONSUMER WHO LIVES IN A EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER COUNTRY, THE UNITED KINGDOM, THE PROVINCE OF QUEBEC (CANADA), AUSTRALIA, OR NEW ZEALAND, THIS LIMITED WARRANTY & AGREEMENT DOES NOT APPLY TO YOU. INSTEAD, YOU ARE ENTITLED TO THE STATUTORY WARRANTIES OR GUARANTEES PROVIDED BY THE JURISDICTION THE HARDWARE WAS PURCHASED IN.

By buying, receiving, or using the Hardware, you agree to this Hardware Limited Warranty & Agreement. If you do not agree, do not use the Hardware, but return it to Valve for a refund as described in the Hardware Refund Policy or to your retailer in accordance with its return policy. Valve will refund your shipping charges for the least expensive method if you return it to Valve for this reason and you have not used the Hardware.

This Hardware Limited Warranty & Agreement (“Warranty”) applies to Valve hardware products including without limitation: Valve Index, Steam Deck and their related accessories (individually and collectively, the "Hardware"). This Warranty is provided by Valve Corporation. For Hardware purchased through the Internet, the Hardware will be deemed for all purposes to have been purchased in the country in which the original Purchaser (“Purchaser”) requested delivery. This Warranty is transferrable to natural persons who receive the Hardware as a gift from the Purchaser; transfer pursuant to this sentence shall not otherwise expand this Warranty. Purchaser remains bound to comply with his or her obligations under this Warranty.

[h3]1.0 Limited Warranty[/h3]

Valve warrants the Hardware to be free from defects in materials and workmanship under ordinary consumer use for one (1) year starting from the date of shipment (the "Warranty Period"). During the Warranty Period, if the Hardware does not work properly due to a defect in materials or workmanship, and provided you follow the return instructions set forth below for obtaining warranty service, Valve will, at Valve's option, either: (i) repair the Hardware; (ii) replace the Hardware with a new or refurbished product with equal or greater features and functions as the Hardware, or (iii) refund your purchase price. UNLESS YOUR LOCAL LAW GIVES YOU A REMEDY THIS WARRANTY CANNOT LIMIT, THIS IS YOUR ONLY REMEDY.

Returns. You may have a right to return your Hardware for a refund within a certain number of days after your purchase is made. To view the Hardware Refund Policy, click [url=https://store.steampowered.com/hardware_order_terms]here[/url].
This Warranty applies, to the extent permitted by law, to any replacement Hardware for the remainder of the original Warranty Period or for ninety (90) days, whichever period is longer. All replaced parts, and all Hardware for which a refund is given, shall become the property of Valve.

[h3]2.0 Service and Return Instructions[/h3]

For detailed instructions about how to obtain warranty service for your Hardware, visit our [url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/04AE-8A9A-F64E-D165]RMA Guide[/url]. International warranty service is only available in countries in which Valve or its retailers actively distribute the Hardware at the time of your purchase.

You must notify Valve of your warranty claim via a help request submitted at [url=https://help.steampowered.com]https://help.steampowered.com[/url] during the Warranty Period and prior to shipping or transporting the Hardware to Valve, provide (upon request) a dated sales receipt for the Hardware, and satisfy all other terms and restrictions set forth in this Warranty. In the United States of America, Valve will provide a return shipping address, prepaid shipping label for the outside of the box you ship, and an RMA (Return Material Authorization) label, which must be placed inside the box you ship. In other countries, you must return the Hardware to your retail place of purchase or as Valve or its representatives may otherwise direct.

Hardware must be transported or shipped to a Valve-designated service center in either the original packaging or in equally protective packaging. Provided the Hardware requires repair or replacement and such repair or replacement is covered by this Warranty, Valve will be responsible for the costs of shipping repaired or replacement Hardware back to you. If the Hardware does not require repair or replacement, you will be responsible for the costs of shipping the Hardware back to you. If you send your Hardware, but do not include all components or information requested by Valve or its representatives, it could delay your repair, and cost you shipping costs to send the requested components or information so that Valve may repair the Hardware. If the Hardware does require repair or replacement, but the Limited Warranty does not apply (e.g., due to misuse), Valve will contact you regarding repair or replacement options and associated costs and payment options, including the costs of shipping the Hardware back to you. Valve will not return Hardware that is shipped to Valve without pre-authorization or return any part or Hardware that is replaced pursuant to the Warranty.

[h3]3.0 Exclusions[/h3]

The Limited Warranty does not apply if the Hardware:

[olist]

[*]has been modified or repaired by anyone except a Valve-designated service center and the cause of the issue for which you seek service is the modification or repair, or damage caused by either;

[*]has had its serial number removed, altered, replaced, defaced, or rendered illegible;

[*]is abused, misused, improperly maintained, mishandled, or neglected;

[*]is damaged by exposure to an accident, natural disaster, or any other events or circumstances outside Valve's control;

[*]is used in any manner inconsistent with the acceptable practices identified in the Hardware manual;

[*]is cleaned in any manner other than as specified in the Hardware manual;

[*]is returned for repair or replacement in packaging that does not meet the specifications identified, above, in the return instructions, or is otherwise mishandled by Purchaser or the common carrier prior to its return; or

[*]is used for commercial purposes.

[/olist]

The Limited Warranty exclusions do not apply to normal usage or ordinary wear and tear, including, without limitation, scratches or marks on the Hardware's exterior derived from ordinary use.

[h3]4.0 Limitations[/h3]

IF YOUR LOCAL LAW GIVES YOU ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY, INCLUDING AN IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, ITS DURATION IS THE SAME AS THIS WARRANTY. SOME STATES, PROVINCES, OR COUNTRIES DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY LASTS, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

UNLESS OTHERWISE PROVIDED UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAW, VALVE IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES; ANY LOSS OF DATA, PRIVACY, CONFIDENTIALITY, OR PROFITS; OR ANY INABILITY TO USE YOUR HARDWARE. THESE EXCLUSIONS APPLY EVEN IF VALVE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF THESE DAMAGES, AND EVEN IF ANY REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. SOME STATES, PROVINCES, AND COUNTRIES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY YOUR LOCAL LAW, IF YOU HAVE ANY BASIS FOR A REMEDY BEYOND REPAIR, REPLACEMENT, OR REFUND, VALVE’S LIABILITY TO YOU CAN BE NO MORE THAN THE PURCHASE PRICE PAID FOR THE HARDWARE.  THIS WARRANTY GIVES YOU SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS, AND YOU MAY ALSO HAVE OTHER RIGHTS, WHICH VARY FROM STATE TO STATE OR COUNTRY TO COUNTRY.

[h3]5.0 Governing Law and Place to Resolve Disputes[/h3]

You and Valve agree that this Warranty shall be deemed to have been made and executed in the State of Washington, U.S.A., and Washington law, excluding conflict of laws principles and the Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, governs all claims arising out of or relating to: (i) any aspect of the relationship between us; (ii) this Warranty; or (iii) the Hardware, its price, the purchase transaction, or anything else relating to the Hardware. You and Valve agree that all disputes and claims between you and Valve (including any dispute or claim that arose before the existence of this or any prior agreement) shall be commenced and maintained exclusively in any state or federal court located in King County, Washington, having subject matter jurisdiction. You and Valve hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts and waive any objections as to personal jurisdiction or venue in such courts.

If the laws where you live mandate alternative dispute resolution options, you may seek a remedy under those options.
