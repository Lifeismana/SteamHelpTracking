[h1]General scam avoidance[/h1]
While some scammers may target Steam users or reference Steam, Steam games, or Valve as part of their scam, it's important to know that these types of online scams are not unique to Steam. Maintaining healthy skepticism in online interactions is important for preventing scams regardless of the platform.

[h1]What is a rank boosting scam?[/h1]

[h5]A store offers rank boosted accounts sale[/h5]

You can never know the origin of an account you purchase, how the account was ranked up, and the seller can always recover their account at a later time. You risk losing all time, effort, and value you add to a purchased account at any time.

[h5]A service offers to access your account and rank it up for you[/h5]

Providing someone else with access to your account carries immense risk for your account in the form of locks and bans for any violations of the  [url=https://store.steampowered.com/subscriber_agreement/]Steam Subscriber Agreement[/url] by the scammer, or any use of cheats to help them improve the account's rank.
