[h1]New USD Pricing For Argentina and Turkey beginning November 20th.[/h1]

The Steam store in Argentina and Turkey will start using USD, along with new regional prices for LATAM and Middle East/North Africa for 25 additional countries/ territories.

Starting on November 20th, Steam will change the currency used for sales in Argentina and Turkey to USD. We are implementing this with two new pricing regions: LATAM - USD (which includes Argentina) and MENA - USD (which includes Turkey).  Some countries/territories in the list below may see pricing increase and others may see pricing decrease depending on how games were priced on Steam prior to this change. As with all Steam pricing, game developers choose the price they want to sell their game on Steam. See below for a list of all countries/territories included in these new pricing regions.

[b]Why Now?[/b]

Exchange rate volatility in Argentina and Turkey in recent years has made it hard for game developers to choose appropriate prices for their games and keep them current. We have heard this loud and clear in our developer meet ups and round table chats. In addition, we have had a hard time keeping Steam payment methods up and running in these countries/territories due to the constant foreign exchange fluctuations, fees, taxes, and logistical issues. Pricing games in USD for Steam customers in Argentina and Turkey will help us provide greater stability and consistency for players and partners, while also enabling us to continue to offer a variety of payment methods to Steam users in those countries/territories.
