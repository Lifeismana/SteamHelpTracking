[h1]Steamwebhelper is not responding[/h1]

If you're seeing this dialog, it means that a key component of Steam was slow to respond to your request. Here is more information on the options offered to you when Steamwebhelper is not responding.

[h2]Restart Steam[/h2]

Frequently this issue can be resolved by simply restarting Steam.

[h2]Restart Steam with GPU Acceleration disabled[/h2]

Some video drivers can have trouble rendering Steam content if GPU acceleration is turned on. Disable this option in settings (Steam > Settings > Interface) to restart Steam with GPU acceleration disabled.  If this seems to solve the problem consider updating your GPU drivers.  If the issue is persistent even with updated drivers you can permanently disable GPU acceleration in the Steam Interface settings, but this will affect UI performance.

[h2]Check whether third party software is interferring with Steam[/h2]

Some third party applications, like anti-virus/security software have been known to potentially cause issues with the webhelper's security sandboxing resulting in hangs or crashes.
