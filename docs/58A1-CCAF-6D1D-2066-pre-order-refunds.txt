[h4]Can I refund my pre-order?[/h4]
Per Steam’s [url=https://store.steampowered.com/steam_refunds/]standard refund policy[/url], you may refund your pre-order any time prior to the release of the game.

If the pre-order was purchased more than 6 months ago, you may not be able to refund back to your original payment method. However, you may still request a credit to your Steam Wallet.

[h4]Can I still refund my pre-order after the game is released?[/h4]

Preordered games that have been released are still eligible for a refund, as long as the refund request is submitted within two weeks of the game’s release, and the game has been played for less than two hours.

[h4]I gifted a pre-order to my friend. Is this gift eligible for a refund?[/h4]

Even if the gift has been redeemed, you may still request a refund. To request a refund on a Steam gift, we will need the gift recipient to first initiate the refund and approve the removal of this purchase from their account.

[*]The gift recipient must first allow the refund by logging into their Steam account from the [url=https://help.steampowered.com]Support page[/url] and selecting the gift.

[*]After the recipient has approved the refund, you can then submit a refund request for that gift.

[h4]Can I still get a refund if I play a game purchased with Advanced Access?[/h4]

Purchases that included Advanced Access qualify for refunds per Steam’s [url=https://store.steampowered.com/steam_refunds/]standard refund policy[/url].

When you pre-purchase an Advanced Access version on Steam, you can request a refund at any time prior to the start of Advanced Access. The standard 14-day refund period also applies and will not start until the release date.
