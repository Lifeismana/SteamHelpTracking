[h1]Embedding Sketchfab Models[/h1]

How do I display a Sketchfab preview on a Workshop item or elsewhere in the Steam Community?

Sketchfab item previews may be utilized in a few places by simply pasting the Sketchfab url:

[olist]

[*][b]A Steam Workshop Submission[/b] - alongside screenshots and videos of your item or mod

[*][b]Community Discussion threads[/b] - in the body of discussion posts

[*][b]Game Events & Announcements[/b] - in the body of the announcement

[/olist]

You can find details on how to link and embed previews on the Sketchfab Tutorial page here: [url=https://support.fab.com/s/article/Steam]https://support.fab.com/s/article/Steam[/url]
