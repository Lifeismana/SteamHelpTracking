[h1]Crosshair disappears when using a gamepad in Portal[/h1]

When I'm using a gamepad in Portal, my crosshair disappears. What's wrong?

To re-enable the crosshair, bring down the console by pressing the ~ key (by default) in game and then typing in the following command and pressing enter:

[code]crosshair 1[/code]

For more information about enabling and using the console, please follow [url=https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=3041-SHZN-9384]this guide[/url].
