[h2]How do I request a refund?[/h2]

All refund requests are handled through [url=https://help.steampowered.com]help.steampowered.com[/url].

For a step-by-step guide, please see our [url=https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=6695-QIKM-7966]How To Request A Refund[/url] FAQ.

[h2]What can I request a refund for?[/h2]

Valve will, upon request via [url=https://help.steampowered.com]help.steampowered.com[/url], issue a refund for any title that is requested within 14 days of purchase and has been played for less than 2 hours (this includes online, offline and shared library playtime). Even if you fall outside of the refund rules we've described, you can submit a request and we'll take a look at it. Please review our [url=http://store.steampowered.com/steam_refunds]Refund Policy[/url] for more information.

[section style=note]In-game purchases within any [url=http://store.steampowered.com/search/?developer=Valve]Valve-developed games[/url] are eligible for a refund within forty-eight hours of purchase, so long as the in-game item has not been consumed, modified or transferred. Third-party developers have the option to enable refunds for in-game items on these terms. Steam will tell you at the time of purchase if the in-game purchase is eligible for a refund.

Before requesting a refund for a missing in-game purchase, please contact the game's support team first. If they are unable to assist, please attach a copy of your correspondence to your support ticket.

[h2]Where is my refund? My refund was approved, but it’s been more than 7 days.[/h2]

Approved refunds can take up to 7 days to appear in your account. Approved Wallet credit may take 24-48 hours to appear in your Steam Wallet. Please Note: Refunds to international payment methods may take longer. If your refund hasn’t appeared after 7 days, please contact your bank directly and ask about pending refunds on your account.

[section style=note]When a refund request is approved within 24 hours of the purchase, the original transaction is cancelled. In many cases it takes up to 30 days for your bank to confirm that Steam never received the funds in the first place. Once confirmed, your bank will release the hold and remove the charge from your  bank statement. Please Note: When a transaction is cancelled, you will not see a credit on your account.

Still can’t find your refund? Please review your recent purchase history; you may have used the wallet funds to make another purchase. You can see your Steam Store purchase history by logging in to the Steam website, or the Steam Client, then clicking on your account name at the top right of the screen and selecting [i]Account Details[/i] > [i]View purchase history[/i].

[h2]I tried to refund an older purchase of mine, but my request was declined. What can I do?[/h2]

Purchases made significantly outside of the 14 day refund window are not eligible for a refund. To ensure future eligibility, please submit refund requests within 14 days of purchase and less than 2 hours of playtime. Please review our [url=http://store.steampowered.com/steam_refunds]Refund Policy[/url] for more information.
