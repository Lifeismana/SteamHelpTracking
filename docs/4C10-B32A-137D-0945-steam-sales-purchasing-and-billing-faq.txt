[h4]My purchase attempts are failing. What can I do?[/h4]

If you are attempting your purchase through the Steam website, please try purchasing through the Steam Client, or vice versa. We also recommend disabling or completely removing any IP proxy or VPN software that you may be using, restart your computer, and test your purchase again.

Visit the [url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/731C-13C7-7D04-A11E]Purchase Issues[/url] article for additional guidance. If your issue persists, please contact [url=https://help.steampowered.com/]Steam Support[/url] for assistance.

[h4]]Where did my Steam Wallet funds go?[/h4]

By default, Steam will always try to use your Steam Wallet funds first when a purchase is made. On the purchase confirmation screen, if you do not switch your intended payment method, your Wallet funds will be spent.

To see your current wallet balance, log into your account and select your Steam Wallet balance located in the top-right corner of your window. To see your complete purchase history, select [i]View purchase history[/i].

[h4]Do I get an extra copy to gift if I already own the game?[/h4]

Unless otherwise stated, you will not receive extra giftable copies for duplicate purchases on a single Steam account.

[h4]I can't purchase the game as a gift. Why?[/h4]

For various reasons, such as common issues, incompatibility with non-Steam versions, or regional restrictions that are required by the game's developer or publisher, some games and addons cannot be gifted.

You can purchase a digital Steam Gift Card for a friend or family memberâ€™s account. Once the gift has been redeemed, they can use the wallet funds to purchase the game or addon for their own account. Visit [url=https://store.steampowered.com/digitalgiftcards/selectgiftcard]Steam Gift Cards[/url] for more information.

[h4]I recently purchased a game that is now on sale. Can I refund the difference?[/h4]

We are unable to refund the difference in price; however, you may request a refund for the initial purchase and repurchase the game at the current sale price. For refund eligibility, please review our [url=http://store.steampowered.com/steam_refunds]Refund Policy[/url]. For detailed instructions on how to submit a refund request, please click [url=https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=6695-QIKM-7966]here[/url].

[h4]I cannot find the content that the Steam Store says that I own. Why?[/h4]

Due to current technical limitations, The Steam Store may show that you own a special edition of a game when you actually only own the base version. Please check your purchase/activation history to determine which version of this game you own.

You can see your Steam Store purchase history by logging in to the Steam website, or the Steam Client, then clicking on your account name at the top right of the screen and selecting [i]Account Details[/i] > [i]View purchase history[/i].

[url id=coupons][/url]

[h4]I have a coupon that I wish to use. Does it stack with a Steam Sale?[/h4]

Unless clearly stated otherwise, promotions such as coupons or loyalty discounts do not stack with Steam Sale pricing.

[url id=wishlist][/url]

[h4]How can I avoid missing sales for the games that I want?[/h4]

Steam's Wishlist feature can be used to receive a notification when a game that you want goes on sale. You can find more information on how to use the Steam Wishlist feature here:
