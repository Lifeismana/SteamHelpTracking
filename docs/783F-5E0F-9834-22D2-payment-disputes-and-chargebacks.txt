[h4]What is a chargeback?[/h4]
A chargeback, also known as a payment dispute, is when the bank reverses a payment made on Steam and returns the funds to their customer’s account.

[h4]What’s the difference between a chargeback and a refund?[/h4]
A chargeback is initiated by the bank on their customer’s behalf and is commonly used to return funds in cases of fraud or unauthorized use of the payment method.

A refund requested is submitted by the customer directly to Steam. You can request a refund for nearly any purchase on Steam—for any reason. If your request is made within fourteen days of purchase and the title has been played for less than two hours, you automatically qualify for a refund. For detailed instructions on how to submit a refund request, please click [url=https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=6695-QIKM-7966]here[/url].

Note: If you’re having an issue with a product, we recommend submitting a refund request through Steam or contacting the developer/publisher of the product for technical assistance. If you’re unable to resolve your issue, reach out to [url=https://help.steampowered.com]Steam Support[/url] to determine next steps.

[h4]How can I remove a chargeback restriction from my account?[/h4]
To protect our users from additional unknown charges, any accounts and purchases associated with the chargebacks are restricted. The quickest way to remove the restriction on your Steam account is for the owner of the payment method to contact their bank and to reverse the dispute. Once the funds are returned to Steam, the restriction is automatically removed, and the disputed content is restored to your account.

Note: Most banks have a limited timeframe in which chargebacks can be reversed. Please contact your bank for further details.

[h4]How long does it take to cancel/reverse a chargeback with my bank?[/h4]
It may take up to 60 days to finalize a dispute reversal. If it’s been more than 60 days and your account is still restricted or your purchases haven’t been restored, please contact [url=https://help.steampowered.com]Steam Support[/url] with an official letter from your bank. The letter will need to include the following information:

[list]

[*]Date of the reversal

[*]Reversal amount(s)

[*]ARN for reversed funds

[*]Trace ID for the reversed funds (optional but helpful for older chargebacks)

[h4]What if hardware is included in the disputed transaction?[/h4]
If a hardware purchase is disputed, your account is automatically restricted. You can remove the restriction by reversing the dispute with your bank or returning the associated hardware. Contact [url=https://help.steampowered.com]Steam Support[/url] for additional guidance.

If you are not satisfied with your Valve Hardware purchase, you can pursue a refund or request product service. You can learn more about this process [url=https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/04AE-8A9A-F64E-D165] here [/url].
