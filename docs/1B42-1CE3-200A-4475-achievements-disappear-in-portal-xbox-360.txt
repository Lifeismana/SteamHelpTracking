[h1]Achievements Disappear in Portal (Xbox 360)[/h1]

When playing advanced maps in Portal, some of my achievements disappear.  Why does this happen and how can I fix it?

This issue occurs specifically when you do the following:

[olist]

[*]Beat an advanced map. [/*]
[*]Load up another advanced map, and save the game. [/*]
[*]Quit the game. [/*]
[*]Start up again, and load your save without looking at the new game menu. [/*]
[*]Beat the advanced map you loaded. [/*]

[/olist]

To resolve this issue:

[olist]

[*]Start the game, open the new game menu. [/*]
[*]Select an advanced chamber (any one) and complete it. [/*]

[/olist]
