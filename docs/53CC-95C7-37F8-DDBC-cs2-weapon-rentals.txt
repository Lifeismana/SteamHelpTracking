[h2]How long do weapon rentals last?[/h2]

[/section]

[section id=howtorent]

[h2]How do I rent weapons?[/h2]
To rent all 17 weapons from the Kilowatt Case players must have a Kilowatt Case and key in their Inventory. When opening the case, players will have the option to either rent all weapons from the Kilowatt Case (minus the exceedingly rare special item) or receive one weapon from the case to keep.

Renting weapons consumes both the Kilowatt Case and the Kilowatt Case key.
