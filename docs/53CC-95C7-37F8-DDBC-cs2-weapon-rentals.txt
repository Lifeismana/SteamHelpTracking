[section id=whatare]

[h2]What are weapon rentals?[/h2]
Weapon rentals in Counter-Strike 2 allow players to temporarily own all weapons from a weapon case in their Counter-Strike 2 Inventory.

When opening a weapon case players are given two options:

[list]

[*]Open to Keep

[*]Open to Rent
[/list]
If players choose "Open to Rent", the key and case will be consumed and all weapons in the case (minus the exceedingly rare item) are added to their in-game Inventory.

Rented weapons can be equipped and played with in all game modes.
[/section]

[section id=howlong]

[h2]How long do weapon rentals last?[/h2]
Weapon rentals last one week (7 days). At the end of the week, equipped rented weapons will be replaced with the stock version of the weapon(s) in players' Loadouts.
[/section]

[section id=whichitems]

[h2]Which weapons cases can I rent items from?[/h2]
Every weapon case in Counter-Strike 2 supports weapon rentals.
[/section]

[section id=modifyrentals]

[h2]Can I modify rented weapons?[/h2]
No. Rented weapons cannot be modified in any way. This means stickers and Name Tags cannot be applied.
[/section]

[section id=rentstattrak]

[h2]Can rented weapons have StatTrak?[/h2]
No. Rented weapons cannot have StatTrak.
[/section]

[section id=rentalwear]

[h2]What wear rating do rented weapons have?[/h2]
The wear rating on all rented weapons is randomized and may vary from Factory New to Battle Scarred.
[/section]

[section id=refunds]

[h2]Are weapon rentals refundable?[/h2]
No. Because the weapon case and key are consumed when renting the weapons, rented weapons are non-refundable.
[/section]

[section id=timeleft]

[h2]How do I check the time remaining on my weapon rentals?[/h2]
Time remaining on rented weapons is shown in your in-game inventory.
[/section]

[section id=steaminv]

[h2]Rented weapons are not visible in my Counter-Strike 2 inventory on Steam. Is this intentional?[/h2]
Yes. Rented weapons are not (and will not be) visible in your Counter-Strike 2 inventory on Steam.
